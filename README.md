### Exercise 1:
Create an HTML file with a button. Using JavaScript, each time a button is clicked use the array below to change the color of the ```Body``` background to the corresponding index. The colors do not have to start over once the last color is reached.

``` ["blue", "red", "yellow", "brown", "orange", "purple", "black", "green"]  ```

##### BONUS Challenges:
Make the colors recycle once the last color is reached.

### Exercise 2:
